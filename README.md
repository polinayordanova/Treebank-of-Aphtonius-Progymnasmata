# Treebank-of-Aphtonius-Progymnasmata
This is the repository containing the treebanked exercises from Aphthonius' Progymnasmata, treebanked by Polina Yordanova. The Greek text has been taken from *Aphthonii Progymnasmata*, a 1926 edition by Hugo Rabe, with the exception of chapter 10Synkrisis, where I accept Julius Petzholdt's interpretation of the text from his edition from 1839. Each exercise is contained within one xml document. In treebanking the text I have followed the Guidelines for the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2.0. by Giuseppe Celano whenever possible; in cases which were not described in the guidelines, I have applied my own interpretation based on similar phenomena.
